Detection of fruit decay

Udates:

1. use the convolution kernel of elliptical 7x7

2. removal of 2 misdetection regions in the detection of apple

3. remove the shadow of the interference detection in the picture

4. using median filter to eliminate salt and pepper noise after image synthesis

5. the accuracy of the range of decay detection has been greatly improved
